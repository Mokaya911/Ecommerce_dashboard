Ecommerce Dashboard
This project is a cool Python app that analyzes e-commerce sales data and shows it in a fancy dashboard with charts. It uses a Jupyter notebook (test.ipynb) to clean and explore the data, and a Dash app (cc.py) to create interactive visualizations like line charts, bar charts, and a pie chart.
What This Project Does

Cleans Data: The test.ipynb notebook fixes messy data (like bad dates or wrong numbers) in a dataset of e-commerce transactions.
Shows Insights: The cc.py Dash app creates a dashboard with:
Total revenue and number of orders.
Top-selling product.
Charts showing sales over time, top products per month, top categories per year, and more!


Fun Visuals: Uses Plotly to make colorful, interactive charts.

Dataset
The project uses a dataset called clean.csv with columns like OrderID, OrderDate, Product, Category, Quantity, UnitPrice, and TotalPrice. If you want to try it, you can use your own dataset with similar columns. The notebook (test.ipynb) shows how to clean it up!
How to Run the Project

Install Python: Make sure you have Python (version 3.7 or higher) installed.
Clone the Repo: Download this project by running:git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Ecommerce-Dashboard.git


Install Libraries: Go to the project folder and install the needed libraries:pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Notebook: Open test.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to see how the data is cleaned and explore some charts.
Run the Dashboard: In the terminal, go to the project folder and run:python cc.py

Then open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to see the dashboard.
Add Your Data: If you have your own clean.csv, put it in the project folder. Update the file path in cc.py if needed.

Files in This Project

test.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that loads, cleans, and visualizes the e-commerce data.
cc.py: A Python script that creates an interactive Dash dashboard.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries you need.
clean.csv (optional): The dataset used (not included if private).

Example Visuals

Monthly Sales Trend: A line chart showing how sales change over time.
Top Products per Month: A bar chart of the top 5 products each month.
Revenue Share by Category: A pie chart showing which categories make the most money.

Notes

The dataset in test.ipynb had some issues (like bad dates or text in number columns). The notebook fixes these so the dashboard works smoothly.
If you donâ€™t have clean.csv, you can use any CSV with similar columns. Check test.ipynb for cleaning steps.

Future Ideas

Add filters to the dashboard to pick specific dates or categories.
Show more stats, like average order value or top customers.
Make the charts even prettier with custom colors!
